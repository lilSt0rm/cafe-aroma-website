    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Café Aroma is not just a coffee shop – it’s a little world of warmth, comfort, and creativity. 
      The idea behind this project was to design a cozy digital space where coffee lovers can feel 
      the same energy they get when stepping into their favorite café.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website was created by <strong>Lily_dev (LilStorm)</strong> as a web development project. 
      My goal was to bring together trendy design, smooth animations, and a welcoming café atmosphere 
      into a multi-page website.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project represents my passion for <em>web development, design, and storytelling</em>. 
      Just like a good cup of coffee, coding is about balance – the right mix of creativity, 
      functionality, and a touch of art.
    </p>

    <h3>✨ The Idea</h3>
    <p>
      The concept is inspired by the cozy feeling of sitting in a café with friends, sipping coffee, 
      and enjoying small moments of joy. I wanted to recreate that vibe online through a modern 
      website full of warmth and animation.
